A random Discord bot platform.

Installation:
=============

Nyx uses the rewritten (WIP) version of Rapptz's discord.py library.

First get Python 3.5+ with Pip and install discord.py:

``python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py[voice]``

Then you can install Nyx with:

``python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Cappycot/nyx``

Nyx

A random Discord Bot

Installation:
=============

Nyx uses the rewritten (WIP) version of Rapptz's discord.py library.

Configuring "info.nyx" is currently a WIP...

To Do:

- [x] Make repository
- [x] Turn module system back to standard Discord cog system so I can not be stupid
- [ ] Rewrite README.md
- [ ] Turn the entire framework into an importable library
- [ ] Move unimportant cogs to another repository

gg this formatting is all probably broken...

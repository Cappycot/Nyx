# Nyx
## A random Discord Bot

### Installation:

Nyx uses the rewritten (WIP) version of Rapptz's discord.py library.

#### Configuring "info.nyx"

Currently a WIP...

### To Do:

- [x] Make repository
- [x] Turn module system back to standard Discord cog system so I can not be stupid.
- [ ] Rewrite README.md
- [ ] Turn the entire framework into an importable library.
